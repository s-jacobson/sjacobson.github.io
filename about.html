    <div class="about-title">About</div>
    <div class="about-details-1">As a hairstylist, I often tell people that no one ends up in my chair by accident.  In addition to what I do technically and creatively,  I connect and interact with my clients on a deeper, soulful level, which gives both of us experiences we deserve and appreciate each and every day. </div>
    <div class="about-details-2">Since my profession is truly "hands on," I feel it paramount that the two of us to build a relationship and get to know one another.  During our initial consultation and/or first visit  I not only share my vision for your hair but a bit of who I am so that my clients can decide if I am the right fit for them. One of the most common connections I make with people is through stories about my Pomeranian, Todd. "Dog people" often tend to find me. Everyone, meet Todd.  Todd is full of personality and larger than life at 8lbs. Everywhere I go, people are drawn to and want to know Todd.</div>
    <div class="about-quote">The meaning of life is to find your gift.  The purpose of life is to give it away.  ~Picasso</div>
